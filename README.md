I developed this Employee Record Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript bootstrap,, php, and mysql
Employee Record Management System (ERMS) is a web-based programme that is used to handle personnel data in a company. It enables users to save, retrieve, and update employee information such as personal information, work information, and other pertinent data. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP are used to create the system. To produce an intuitive user experience, the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The application's functionality is built with JavaScript, which gives users with a dynamic and interactive experience. The application's backend is written in PHP, which allows it to store, retrieve, and update employee data in a database. MySQL, a relational database management system, is used to construct the database
